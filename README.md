# local_manifests for this repos
There it is some changes to use a stable source to build LOS15 or LOS-Based ROMs on moto msm8916 devices (mostly surnia, but there's osprey, harpia and more). If you got some change or suggestion or fix for your device, feel free to pull request idk.

## How many changes do i have to do?
Idk, this will be added later

## The test branch
There will be a test branch to mess up and if every new change works fine, will be merged on main branch
